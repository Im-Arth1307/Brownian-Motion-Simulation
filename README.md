# Brownian Motion Robot Simulation

A Python simulation of a robot moving in a bounded square area following Brownian motion principles. Developed as part of the **JdeRobot GSoC 2025 Python Challenge**.

## Brownian Motion
Brownian Motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid due to their collision with
other atoms or molecules. Certain robot applications like exploration, coverage and swarm
dynamics require the use of Brownian Motion. This challenge requires you to implement
and simulate Brownian Motion type behavior on a robot.
## Python Module


This project is structured as a Python module containing:
- `brownian_motion.py`: Core logic for the robot simulation.
- `simulation.py`: A sample application that runs the simulation and displays it using `matplotlib`.

---
## Requirements
- Python 3

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

Install Dependencies: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Deployment

To run the simulation use the following command:

```bash
  python simulation.py
```
